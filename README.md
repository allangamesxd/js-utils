# Starting
to start with this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/new-js-utils), put this in the top of you code:
```js
const { isNumber, isOdd, Print, math } = require("new-js-utils");
```
or if you want just give a name to a variable and the value to `require("js-utils")`
ex. 
```js
const utils = require("new-js-utils");
```
# Functions info:
*  Print 
 * * ` It's like console.log but, it will make you save time in you code.`
 * isOdd
 * * `Returns true if the number is odd and false if the number is even.`
 * isNumber
 * * `Returns true if the value is a number or false if the value is NaN`
 
# `I will add more in the future...`
